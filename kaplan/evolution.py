In charge of evolving a population for the set
number of mating events.

Can also decide upon another stopping condition
whereby there is a set of conformers with a suitably
low energy (i.e. good fitness).

Haven't decided on whether to make this an object or
not yet.

Needs to contain:
* stopping condition
* what kinds of mutations to perform
* selection rules (i.e. tournament)
